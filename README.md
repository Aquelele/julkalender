# D-sektionens Julkalender

This repository is what D-sektionen's "Julkalender" is based on.
It is built in Django and uses Javascript for some functions, like the Youtube-player.

## Why so old frontend?

Nostalgic.

## Can I change the music?

Yes, go to `julkalender\static\julkalender\js\music.js`. There you will find a lists of youtube video ids.
